		<h2 id="content">A Brief Overview</h2>
		<p>I'm a data analytics specialist and software engineer. I love the journey as much as the destination; I thrive on challenges that deliver results.</p>
		<p>I'm a partner with <a href="https://www.vaxagroup.com">Vaxa Group</a> and we collectively provide services in business advisory, communications and project support. My arm of the business is Vaxa Tech, and we can help you uncover and understand your data and software challenges and translate these into commercial and operational outcomes for your organisation. In plain english (which we prefer, anyway), we can help with anything data-related including data migration or warehousing, software development, website development, or just general techy problems. If this sounds like something you're interested in, please <a href="https://www.vaxagroup.com/contact">reach out</a> for a no-obligation chat with my team. We genuinely care about your success.</p>
		<p>I'm an avid (but amateur) photographer. I love shooting landscapes, particularly out in nature. You can find my work on <a href="{{ site.instagram_url }}">Instagram</a>. I also spend my spare time working on electronics, software hobby projects, my car and staying up to date on everything Formula 1.</p>
